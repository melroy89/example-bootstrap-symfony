# Symfony Bootstrap example project

A Symfony bootstrap example project for reference only. It's using the Symfony Flex application setup.

It doesn't contain any code apart from what Symfony / Symfony Flex / composer installs.

## Why?

I use this just to see how a clean Symfony project looks like from scratch (for reference), like config files, folder structures, additional PHP files, etc.
